\title{Main function to calculate the risk/performance estimate and calculate the
standard error of the estimate using bootstrapping.}
\usage{
.fmmc.se(fmmcObj, nboot = 50, estimate.func, cl = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{fmmcObj}{object returned by fmmc proc. This is a comprehensive object
with all data for factors and returns.}

\item{nboot}{number of bootstap samples. Not sure how many repetations are
reuired but remember bias-variance tradeoff. Increasing nboot will only
reduce variance and not have a significant effect on bias(estimate)}

\item{estimate.func}{this is a handle to the function used for calulating
the perfomance/risk measure.}

\item{cl}{A cluster for running across multiple cores}
}
\description{
Main function to calculate the risk/performance estimate and calculate the
standard error of the estimate using bootstrapping.
}
\details{
bootstrapping in our  case can be painfully slow, so we exploit the parallel
capabilities of boot function. All cores on your machine are used.
We use the boot call from the boot library for calculating the estimate and
its standard error.
