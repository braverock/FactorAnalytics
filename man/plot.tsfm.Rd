\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \code{tsfm} produced by \code{fitTsfm}.}

\item{which}{a number to indicate the type of plot. If a subset of the plots
is required, specify a subset of the numbers 1:12 for group plots and 1:19
for individual plots. If \code{which=NULL} (default), the following menu
appears: \cr \cr
For plots of a group of assets: \cr
1 = Factor model coefficients: Alpha, \cr
2 = Factor model coefficients: Betas, \cr

1 = Actual and fitted,\cr

18 = Rolling regression over a 24-period observation window, \cr
19 = Asset returns vs factor returns (single factor model)}

\item{f.sub}{numeric/character vector; subset of indexes/names of factors to
include for group plots. Default is 1:2.}

\item{a.sub}{numeric/character vector; subset of indexes/names of assets to
include for group plots. At least 2 assets must be selected. Default is 1:6.}

\item{plot.single}{logical; If \code{TRUE} plots the characteristics of an
individual asset's factor model. The type of plot is given by
\code{which}. Default is \code{FALSE}.}

\item{asset.name}{name of the individual asset to be plotted. Is necessary
if \code{x} contains multiple asset fits and \code{plot.single=TRUE}.}

\item{colorset}{color palette to use for all the plots. The 1st element will
be used for individual time series plots or the 1st object plotted, the 2nd
element for the 2nd object in the plot and so on.}

\item{legend.loc}{places a legend into one of nine locations on the chart:
"bottomright", "bottom", "bottomleft", "left", "topleft", "top", "topright",
"right", or "center". Default is "bottomright". Use \code{legend.loc=NULL}
to suppress the legend.}

\item{las}{one of \code{0, 1, 2, 3} to set the direction of axis labels, same as
in \code{plot}. Default is 1.}

\item{lwd}{set the line width, same as in \code{\link{plot}}. Default is 2.}

\item{maxlag}{optional number of lags to be calculated for ACF. Default is 15.}

\item{...}{further arguments to be passed to other plotting functions.}

\description{
Generic \code{plot} method for object of class \code{tsfm}.
Plots chosen characteristic(s) for one or more assets.
}
\details{
The function can be used for group plots and individual plots. User can
select the type of plot either from the menu prompt (default) or directly
via argument \code{which}.

In case multiple plots are needed, the menu is repeated after each plot
(enter 0 to exit). User can also input a numeric vector of plot options via
\code{which}.

Group plots are the default. The selected assets in \code{a.sub} and
selected factors in \code{f.sub} are plotted depending on the
characteristic chosen. The default is to show the first 2 factors and first
6 assets.

Setting \code{plot.single=TRUE} enables individual plots. If there is more
than one asset fit by \code{x}, \code{asset.name} should be specified.
In case the \code{tsfm} object \code{x} contains only a single asset fit,
plot.tsfm can infer \code{asset.name} without user input.

CUSUM plots (individual asset plot options 15, 16 and 17) are applicable
only for \code{fit.method="LS"}.

Modified residuals, rolling regression and single factor model plots
(individual asset plot options 4, 18 and 19) are not applicable for
\code{variable.selection="lars"}.

The last option for plotting asset returns vs. factor returns (individual
asset plot option 19 and group plot 12) are only applicable for single factor
models.

\examples{

 # load data
data(managers, package = 'PerformanceAnalytics')

fit.macro <- fitTsfm(asset.names = colnames(managers[,(1:6)]),
                     factor.names = colnames(managers[,(7:9)]),
                     rf.name = "US 3m TR",
                     data = managers)

# for group plots (default), user can select plot option from menu prompt
# menu is repeated to get multiple types of plots based on the same fit
# plot(fit.macro)

# choose specific plot option(s) using which
# plot the first 2 factor betas of first 4 assets fitted above
plot(fit.macro, f.sub=1:2, a.sub=1:4, which=2)

# plot factor model residuals scatterplot matrix, with histograms, density
# overlays, correlations and significance stars
plot(fit.macro, which=6)

# for individual plots: set plot.single=TRUE and specify asset.name
# histogram of residuals from an individual asset's factor model fit
plot(fit.macro, plot.single=TRUE, asset.name="HAM1", which=13)

# for individual plots, the "which" argument specifies plot type.
# Plots 15:17 require the suggested "strucchange" package.
# 17 plots the Recursive estimates (RE) test of LS regression coefficients.
require(strucchange)
plot(fit.macro, plot.single=TRUE, asset.name="HAM1", which=17)
