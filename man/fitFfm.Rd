\description{
Fit a fundamental (cross-sectional) factor model using ordinary
least squares or robust regression. Fundamental factor models use observable
asset specific characteristics (or) fundamentals, like industry
classification, market capitalization, style classification (value, growth)
etc. to calculate the common risk factors. An object of class \code{"ffm"}
is returned.
}
\details{
Estimation method "LS" corresponds to ordinary least squares using
\code{\link[stats]{lm}} and "Rob" is robust regression using
\code{\link[RobStatTM]{lmrobdetMM}}. "WLS" is weighted least squares using estimates
of the residual variances from LS regression as weights (feasible GLS).
Similarly, "W-Rob" is weighted robust regression.

The weights to be used in "WLS" or "W-Rob" can be set using
\code{resid.scaleType} argument which computes the residual variances in one of the following ways -
sample variace, EWMA, Robust EWMA and GARCH(1,1). The inverse of these residual variances
 are used as the weights. For EWMA model, lambda = 0.9 is used as default and for GARCH(1,1)
 omega = 0.09, alpha = 0.1, and beta = 0.81 are used as default as mentioned in Martin & Ding (2017).
 These default parameters can be changed using the arguments \code{lambda},
 \code{GARCH.params} for EWMA and GARCH respectively. To compute GARCH
 parameters via MLE, set \code{GARCH.MLE} to \code{TRUE}. Make sure you have
 the rugarch package installed and loaded, as is merely listed as SUGGESTS.

Standardizing style factor exposures: The exposures can be standardized into
z-scores using regular or robust (see \code{rob.stats}) measures of location
and scale. Further, \code{weight.var}, a variable such as market-cap, can be
used to compute the weighted mean exposure, and an equal-weighted standard
deviation of the exposures about the weighted mean. This may help avoid an
ill-conditioned covariance matrix. Default option equally weights exposures
of different assets each period.

If \code{rob.stats=TRUE}, \code{\link[RobStatTM]{covRob}} is used to compute a
robust estimate of the factor covariance/correlation matrix, and,
\code{\link[robustbase]{scaleTau2}} is used to compute robust tau-estimates
of univariate scale for residuals during "WLS" or "W-Rob" regressions. When
standardizing style exposures, the \code{\link[stats]{median}} and
\code{\link[stats]{mad}} are used for location and scale respectively.
When \code{resid.scaleType} is EWMA or GARCH, the residual covariance is equal to the
diagonal matrix of the estimated residual variances in last time period.


The original function was designed by Doug Martin and initially implemented
in S-PLUS by a number of University of Washington Ph.D. students:
Christopher Green, Eric Aldrich, and Yindeng Jiang. Guy Yollin ported the
function to R and Yi-An Chen modified that code. Sangeetha Srinivasan
re-factored, tested, corrected and expanded the functionalities and S3
methods.
