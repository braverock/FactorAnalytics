Description: Linear factor model fitting for asset returns (three major types-
    time series, fundamental and statistical factor models); related risk
    (volatility, VaR and ES) and performance attribution (factor-contributed vs
    idiosyncratic returns); tabular displays of risk and performance reports;
    factor model Monte Carlo, single and multiple imputation methods for 
    simulating returns and backfilling unequal histories. The package authors 
    would like to thank S&P GLOBAL MARKET INTELLIGENCE for kindly contributing 
    fundamental data on 300 publicly traded companies to this open source package. 
    Commonly referred to as "alpha factors" or "scores", the variables are
